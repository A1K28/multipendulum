# Multi-Pendulum Project
This build supports both simple and complex pendulum (assuming no friction/air resistance). 5 formulas of equations of motion for the multi-simple pendulum are derived via MatLab and the repository contains an example file for deriving complex pendulum equations of motion. This project allows for a fully customizable/interactive pendulum simulation with 3 PDE methods and an ability to use none of them, comes with a GUI, is easily generalizable.  This project is to simply show that it is possible to create a simulation of N number of pendulums at once given the computational resources.

## Accession
To run this project simply clone the repository and run "py_pend_run.bat". Keep in mind to install the dependecy:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Demo

## Contributing
I welcome any pull requests. Keep in mind that the "my_gui.py" file requires optimization and reading it in its current state may be hard, focus on the main python script. Any questions regarding how it works can be directly sent to me at: aleksandrekhorbaladze@gmail.com
